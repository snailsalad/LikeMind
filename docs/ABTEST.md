# A/B Test 1
Metrics:
Login frequency, retention time, and Click-Through Rate (CTR).
Hypothesis:
A high-contrast color scheme (dark blue and yellow) will improve user retention, engagement, and CTR on matches.
Experiment:
Using Firebase Remote Config, we will show half of users a new logo with a high-contrast color scheme, while the other half continue with the default design. Engagement metrics will be tracked over the test period.

# A/B Test 2
User Story #: 4 \
Metrics: Login frequency, retention time, Click-Through Rate (CTR) \
Hypothesis: Choosing a different, high-contrast color scheme will increase user retention and engagement and increase the click-through rate on matches. \
Experiment: We will change the primary and secondary colors on the app to a high-contrast color scheme using dark blue and yellow and see if users spend more or less time using our app. We will use a remote config parameter in firebase to control the app's color scheme and change the colors that way. We will roll out the high-contrast alternate color scheme to half the user base, while the other half will continue with the original color scheme. \
Variations: Control variable will be the default/neutral color scheme already in place, while the variable will be the high-contrast alternate color scheme.
